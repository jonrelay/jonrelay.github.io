        	<h1>In 1914, WW1 began.</h1>

<p>In 1914, the world engaged in a war unlike any other. No one was prepared for what was about to happen.</p>

        	<p>Relay tells the story of a British morse code technician during WW1, engaging in some of the key battles and stories from the time. Your job is to keep headquarters up to date each day with news, important events and to look after your platoons resources. Without food, your men go hungry. Without ammo, they cant fight.</p>

        	<p>Each message you send back to headquarters is through morse code, and with your trusty manual, you'll be able to make it home for christmas. At least thats what everyone keeps saying.</p>

        	<p>Relay is coming to PC/Mac/Linux sometime early 2017</p>
